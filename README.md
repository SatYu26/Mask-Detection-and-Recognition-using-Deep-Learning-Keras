# INTRODUCTION

To create our face mask detector, we trained a two-class model of people wearing masks and people not wearing masks.<br>

We fine-tuned MobileNetV2 on our mask/no mask dataset and obtained a classifier that is ~99% accurate.<br>

We then took this face mask classifier and applied it to both images and real-time video streams by:<br>

<ul>
Detecting faces in images/video<br>
Extracting each individual face<br>
Applying our face mask classifier<br>
</ul>

Our face mask detector is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s also computationally efficient, making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, Jetosn, Nano, etc.).<br>
